# Finger Lift Switch 
The Finger Lift Switch is an assistive switch that is activated by lifting a resting finger upwards. The switch activation distance is approximately 5 mm and the required force is about 5 grams-force.

Connect the cable to an assistive device with a 3.5 mm input jack. The user's lifting fingertip should be placed under the finger lift pad, resting on a lower surface or splint.
When the user raises their lifting finger, the finger lift lever will rotate and activate the switch. The switch will de-activate when the user lowers their lifting finger back to the resting surface.
